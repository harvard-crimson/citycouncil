Click on the tabs to examine the five women and 20 men vying to fill the Council&rsquo;s nine seats: who they are and where they fall on the issues.

                       <p>I think the presence of local businesses is great benefit to a neighborhood. In fact, it raises the value of living or going to school there.

                       Last term I introduced Bridgestep, which uses analytics to analyze crime trends. So when you, or if you for example, for now if we get a number of 911 calls that are suspicious, or there has been a homeowner break in or my car has been broken into, we have the analytics, the analytics are now in place through the introduction of Bridgestep.  This system will see that oh we usually get no calls for car break ins and now all of a sudden we have had three. That will automatically trigger a detective to go out and start investigating and you know talking to neighbors and figure out what is going on.  I think that the challenge that I have seen when I have gone to community meetings [is that] people don&rsquo;t call 911.

                       I think Cambridge does have a history of being a leader, we were the first to adopt stretch code, we have been continually at the forefront of requiring more energy efficient buildings to be built. I think we should obviously continue to lead in that way.  I have spoken with members who were signers of the original [Net Zero/Connolly] petition who, even they, recognize that the petition as written has significant flaws, for example the requirement to purchase Reqs, they aren&rsquo;t audited and they aren&rsquo;t standardized.  I would much rather see money invested in renewable energy sources that net add to our own local grid, serving our own local population.

                      This term I have been chairing neighborhood planning and trying to bring up a lot of discussions to the council and people.  I think that the reality is that there is no single thing that is going to fix the housing crutch that we have in the City of Cambridge.  So you need to have a plan, you need to understand the housing market and put housing on the market each year to match that vacancy rate if you want to control the price of housing and not keep pricing people outside of Cambridge and keep gentrifying to the point where only millionaires can live here and you need to do, when you build that housing, you need to build it in proportion to the diverse array of housing types that people are looking for.

                       So I introduced—there was this article written up in the WSJ on this—[a measure] requiring any new developer in Kendall square to set aside at least 10 percent of space for entrepreneurs and start up companies.  I would like to expand that to the rest of Kendall square and I think that there are other places in Cambridge that this would be appropriate for, like Alewife and Harvard square in particular… We would like to create more space for entrepreneurs and start up companies in Harvard Square.  [I have] worked very closely with developers to try [and implement this] and when they have retailing vacancy to fill it with a locally owned retailer as opposed to some big chain because economic studies have showed that locally owned businesses put a lot more money back into the community than businesses that are not locally owned, because they hire people who live here.

                       Harvard Square has lost a lot of local businesses. We&rsquo;ve seen a bump in nightlife but we&rsquo;ve lost a lot of local flavor. Curious George, it&rsquo;s still local it&rsquo;s still a great store but now it&rsquo;s more of a tourist destination while the original store was a neighborhood destination. It just goes to show the changing trend in the square.

                       I don&rsquo;t think we as a council or as the city are very intentional about our relationship and I think Harvard has its own plans, universities last for centuries so they will interact with us as fits their plans, not that Harvard is being rude—same thing with MIT.  But if we want Harvard  to be a partner in this, that with the other thing, we need to be the ones to instigate that partnership—we need to be much more intentional than we have been in the past.

                      I am always interested in seeing more officers on foot or on bicycles rather than in cruisers—that is not necessarily the police department&rsquo;s view. They have to move officers around town relatively quickly and from their perspective they may see more value in the flexibility of a vehicle compared to what someone on foot or a bicycle could do, or the equipment that is available to an officer in the cruiser versus one on the bicycle.

                       I think we need to be adaptive in terms of climate change. We need to help people prepare extreme weather events that are certainly coming, hurricane sandy missed Boston by five and a half hours, that is five and a half hours away from high tide, if that had happened we would have seen in Boston, water at the steps of city hall, much of Cambridge would have been flooded extensively—we are not going to be that lucky forever, people need to understand better how to prepare for these events, how to minimize the damage, and then how to recover from them.  It&rsquo;s going to be a city-business-resident partnership and I think we are nearly not as far along in that regard as we should be… As far as other policies—I think I would support a solar policy which would put a requirement in the zoning code for buildings of a certain square footage of a certain amount of square footage on the roof, and a certain orientation because that all affects how useful solar can be.

                       So we cap this for a reason. And I support the cap, every once in a while we bump it but we constantly are bumping against this idea of what is Harvard square. If it is Lansdowne street or the alley in Boston, off of Boylston street, which has got six, seven, eight bars and becomes a destination spot for everyone between the ages of 19 and 31 on Friday night—that is a different sort of square.  That is not a good or a bad square, but that is a different sort of square and if you live in the Harvard square area that might not be the square that you want. The noise coming out of the bars and restaurants at night, the drunks wandering through your neighborhood, the cars and so forth getting parked are all things people would prefer to avoid.  If you are a business owner and think boy my business shuts down at 11 but I think I could sell a lot more pizza at 1:30 at night if the bar were next door or if I could beer until 1:30 at night then you would think that maybe this is a good idea and I think Cambridge is always struggling to find that balance. Harvard square is this stunningly vibrant place, I don&rsquo;t think we need to accommodate every or most alcohol licenses.

You have instances where if a landlord wants to rent out a storefront--the zoning code is so complicated that there are probably--9 times out of 10 that business is going to have to get a variance...to do business there...That place will be vacant while they&rsquo;re getting a variance.

They&rsquo;re going to be solved as a long-term networking project with the help of city council and all of the stakeholders involved.</p> <p>There&rsquo;s not necessarily a lot of cross talk between homeless shelters and healthcare providers and other city resources on those issues.

The other thing is a holistic view between the local business associations, the city councilors, local business leaders and business themselves and other stakeholders on consistent events and cross talk.</p> <p>I&rsquo;ve seen first hand how challenging it is, and if we&rsquo;re not going to rewrite the [licensing] laws we at least have to be proactive about educating people on how they can get throughout the system. Because right now the only people getting through the system have millions and millions of dollars to do very, very big projects and that is not the way that we&rsquo;re going to increase the number of jobs, the nature of our jobs, our art and culture, our community service oriented businesses in Cambridge.  It&rsquo;s going to be through the smaller operations that grow from 3 to 12 people and then continue sustainably.  That&rsquo;s where we get the vibrancy in Cambridge, and that&rsquo;s where we get the innovative spirit, and right now we&rsquo;re just being stymied by regulation and complexity.</p>

                       <p>We can&rsquo;t regulate the price of housing. We lost rent control 20 years ago. Government can only do so much. We gain housing by two means. One is we find and build it ourselves and politicians are loathe to come before taxpayers saying I want another 5 million dollars for the low income people when the taxpayers are having problems paying for their own heat. The other way we do it is by inclusionary units. Inclusionary units on a given percentage will be put aside for lower income people granting the developer even more profitable units in exchange.</p> <p>The problem is a ratio of roughly 6 to 1, you are getting a lot of density and I&rsquo;m afraid of it.

                       <p>It&rsquo;s all about the rent. That&rsquo;s undeniable. If the landlords are going to charge excessive rents you&rsquo;re not going to get small businesses… It&rsquo;s futile for councilors to try to control what is simply a function of rent. The property owners are going to determine who they want in there because they determine the prices they can charge.” “We&rsquo;ve been very generous the last few years in the number of new licenses we&rsquo;ve permitted. A certain category is the nontransferable. They&rsquo;re issued one by one where an appropriate use is deemed instead of the traditional ownership liquor license where the few and privileged got their license 40 years ago and they own it, so that they can transfer it. So of these newer licenses, these nontransferable types, there are several in Harvard square in the last few years and I think they&rsquo;re working.</p> <p>It makes Cambridge a really second-rate place when you can&rsquo;t even find a restroom. Harvard square needs a public restroom desperately, Central Square needs it desperately, and other parts of the city as well.</p>

I think there just needs to be a greater relationship between the police and the community.

                       I come from the school of thought—and from what I&rsquo;ve learned working in public safety—that when you make incremental changes in terms of patrols and details and a larger police presence, you see a large change in behavior. It&rsquo;s an excellent, precise tool that we can use in terms of safety to make sure that our presence is known. It allows crime to decrease. We&rsquo;ve done this in part, but it&rsquo;s a matter of being vigilant, and if we keep working we can make this situation completely reverse.

We do our best to bring divergent viewpoints to the table and work out solutions, whether those are regulations or instate laws. A good example of this would be the Updated Bottle Bill or the Solid Waste Master Plan.

That&rsquo;s the very first step to making sure that we see a successful Harvard Square into the future. We want to make sure that rent&rsquo;s not out of reach for folks, and to encourage the profit and t revenue associated with new businesses moving in.

It&rsquo;s that some of our buildings go a little bit higher but at the same time, as we&rsquo;re building new housing, we&rsquo;re doing so by building around transportation nobes like T-stops, so that people are encouraged to use that instead of purchasing a car.

                       <p>Harvard and MIT need to house their graduate students. It&rsquo;s not the only thing that we need to do, but it&rsquo;s something that Harvard and MIT have the resources to do immediately.</p> <p>We also need to look at inclusionary zoning. ...one of the members of the [Cambridge Housing] Authority said that they are finding that developers don&rsquo;t even care about the additional cost of doing 15% of affordable housing, this market is so hot that people can afford to not even think about 15% affordable units. So now is the time to start taking a careful look at moving that up to an even higher number.</p> <p>In each municipality that adopts the [Community Preservation Act] CPA, they can choose up to 80% for either of those categories. None of them can go below 10%. Cambridge has chosen 80% for affordable housing, and there is a consensus in Cambridge that we should stick to that.</p>

The people who live in poverty are an aspect of that waste. They are human resources.

            <p>Luis Vasquez, 25, describes himself as an "activist of the youthful go-getter generation." He graduated from Cambridge Rindge and Latin High School in 2006, and his plans to go to then pursue higher education were halted when he became a father at the age of 19. The experience of being a teenage father, he says, has inspired him to "guiding young people" and serving the Cambridge community. Vasquez has been a lifelong Cantabrigian, and is the son of Latin American immigrants. He identifies his political priorities as providing greater opportunities for affordable living in Cambridge, aiding non-profit organizations, providing a support network for the graduates of Cambridge public schools, and encouraging health and fitness among Cambridge&rsquo;s youth. </p>

            <p>Being a Cambridge resident for the past 42 years, James Williamson takes pride in his knowledge of the city. If elected to City Council, one of the main concerns that he intends to focus on is a growing commercialism in Harvard Square. Williamson intends to support local business growth by making it easier for small businesses to acquire permits. He also is interesting in finding ways to communicate with both landlords and small business owners to keep Cambridge rents down. Williamson wants to encourage MIT and Harvard to house all University graduate students. Opening up more housing for non-students would allow for more space dedicated to public and subsidized housing, as well as lower overall rents as the availability of apartments increases. Williamson is also interested in raising the percentage (currently around 12%) of housing units allocated to affordable housing. Williamson intends to work with Harvard and Drew Faust to possibly renegotiate Harvard&rsquo;s Payments in Lieu of Taxes (PILOT) to the city of Cambridge. He believes that Harvard owes the city of Cambridge more attention, especially on the forefront of the Allston campus construction and the traffic that will create. Williamson is in favor of increased communication between the Cambridge City Council and all local Universities, especially Harvard. Regarding local crime, Williamson supports the idea of increasing community police and strengthening the relationship between HUPD and Cambridge Police instead of strengthening punishment and surveillance measures. </p>

            <p>Elie is running because he believes that the democratic government should be restored to Cambridge, as to produce a government that is open to the citizens of the city. His opinion is that the City Council and the Government of Cambridge are ignoring what&rsquo;s happening in the world, namely climate change.</p>
